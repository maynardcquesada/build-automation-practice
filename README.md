# build-automation-practice
 A Unity project that showcases my current knowledge of specific softwares, build tools, and practices. This includes the following: Use of Perforce as source/version control system, use of Unity Build Pipeline to build the project using a shell script, creating Unit Testing with built-in Unity Test Runner using shell script executable and lastly, using Jenkins to automate the build process of by way of Perforce trigger -> test -> build -> deploy.
